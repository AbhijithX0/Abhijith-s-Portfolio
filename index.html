                Hello! I am currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at VISAT, Elanji, starting in 2024. My journey into the tech world began after completing my higher secondary education at OLLHSS, Uzhaavoor, in March 2024. Before that, I completed my 10th grade at SVRSMS, Kudakkachira, in 2022. <br><br>

From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and technology. This curiosity led me to explore various programming languages and development tools, eventually nurturing a deep passion for coding. My interest in front-end development grew as I learned about the creativity and precision involved in building user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces. <br><br>

In addition to my technical pursuits, I am an avid reader. I believe that reading not only broadens my knowledge but also enhances my problem-solving skills and creativity, which are crucial for a successful career in technology. I enjoy delving into both technical literature and fiction, finding inspiration and relaxation in equal measure. <br><br>

My aspiration is to become a proficient front-end developer, capable of delivering high-quality and efficient web solutions. I look forward to working with clients to bring their visions to life, creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. With a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for continuous learning, I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my career. <br><br>
